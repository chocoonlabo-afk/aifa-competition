      <h3>1. General Rule: No Refunds</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>All entry fees are non-refundable.</strong> Once an entry has been
          submitted and payment has been completed, the fee cannot be refunded under normal
          circumstances, regardless of:
          <ul>
            <li>withdrawal by the Participant,</li>
            <li>failure to submit the required performance video or materials,</li>
            <li>illness, scheduling conflicts, or other personal reasons,</li>
            <li>disagreement with adjudication or results.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          This no-refund policy applies to:
          <ul>
            <li>entry fees for all categories,</li>
            <li>administrative fees,</li>
            <li>any other non-tangible Services defined in our competition guidelines.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>2. Optional Purchases (Trophies and Other Items)</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Fees for optional purchases, such as trophies, medals, or other physical items
          (“Physical Items”), are also <strong>non-refundable</strong> once the order has
          been placed.
        </li>
        <li>
          AIFA is not responsible for:
          <ul>
            <li>delays in delivery caused by postal or courier services,</li>
            <li>loss or damage during shipment,</li>
            <li>customs inspections or import restrictions,</li>
            <li>incorrect or incomplete delivery addresses provided by the recipient.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Customs duties, taxes, and any other import-related fees are the sole
          responsibility of the recipient.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>3. Duplicate Payments and Technical Errors</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          In the event of a clear <strong>duplicate payment</strong> (for example, if the
          same entry is accidentally paid twice), AIFA may, at its discretion, arrange a
          partial or full refund or credit, after verifying:
          <ul>
            <li>the duplicate transaction,</li>
            <li>the payer’s identity,</li>
            <li>that no corresponding additional Services were provided.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Where a payment failed due to a technical issue but funds were still captured by
          the payment provider, we will cooperate with the payment provider (e.g., PayPal)
          to resolve the issue. In some cases, the payment provider may process the refund
          directly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Participants must contact AIFA promptly with evidence of the duplicate or
          erroneous payment, including transaction IDs and receipts.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>4. Competition Changes or Cancellation</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          AIFA reserves the right to change the format, schedule, or other aspects of the
          competition where reasonably necessary.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the unlikely event that the entire competition edition is{' '}
          <strong>fully cancelled by AIFA</strong> without a replacement or alternative
          arrangement:
          <ul>
            <li>
              AIFA may offer refunds, partial refunds, or credits for future editions, at
              its sole discretion.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          AIFA is not responsible for any additional costs incurred by Participants, such
          as:
          <ul>
            <li>instrument or studio rental,</li>
            <li>recording costs,</li>
            <li>travel or accommodation,</li>
            <li>other third-party services.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>5. Chargebacks and Disputes</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          If a Participant initiates a chargeback or payment dispute through a bank or
          payment provider without first contacting AIFA, we reserve the right to:
          <ul>
            <li>
              provide evidence of the transaction and these Terms &amp; Conditions to the
              payment provider,
            </li>
            <li>treat this as a breach of our Terms.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Successful participation in the competition (including adjudication and results)
          is conditional upon fees being validly paid and not reversed. AIFA may:
          <ul>
            <li>disqualify a Participant, or</li>
            <li>revoke awards if a payment is reversed or deemed fraudulent.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
