          on AIFA’s platforms.
        </li>
        <li>

            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          If a parent/guardian withdraws consent for future uses, AIFA will take reasonable

            <li>previously printed materials cannot be recalled,</li>
            <li>

          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>5. Withdrawal of Consent</h3>
      <ol>

          You may contact AIFA to request limitation or withdrawal of media use for future
          materials.
        </li>

            <li>legal obligations,</li>
            <li>the public record nature of competition results,</li>
            <li>the technical feasibility of removal.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          This may result in:
          <ul>
            <li>removing selected posts or media where feasible, or</li>
            <li>
              retaining certain content as part of the official competition archive.
